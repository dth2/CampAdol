### Aims
The Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention (CAMP) is a 5-year research and dissemination project between Emory University, University of Washington, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with other academic and health department partners. The UW contribution will address HIV prevention questions that relate to understanding the interlocking relationships between HIV prevention methods, primarily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and STD transmission and treatment, to understand the future course of the HIV epidemic and STD transmission. Because of the complex feedback and high-dimensionality of the behaviors and subgroups of interest, agent-based modeling is well-suited. These model-based answers will be critical for motivating policy-makers around funding prioritization for PrEP and the settings in which it would be emphasized. All concurred that due to the complexity of agent-based model development and the nuanced questions, this is a long-term activity that will take on different phases across the 5 years of the project.


### Research Question 1
**How might racial disparities in HIV incidence and prevalence worsen as PrEP is scaled up?** Based on the racial disparities in the HIV care continuum and disparities in healthcare access and utilization among HIV-negative MSM, it is likely that there are and will be continue to be meaningful racial disparities in access to PrEP in the United States, with non-black MSM having greater access relative to black MSM. If higher and meaningful levels of PrEP coverage is seen for non-black MSM, the resulting gap in HIV protection could compound disparities in HIV incidence and prevalence. Key modifiers of this would be the degree of PrEP scale- up and interventions that altered PrEP access, such as Medicaid expansion in areas without it. These factors would form the basis for sensitivity analyses.
