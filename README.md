### Aims
The Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention (CAMP) is a 5-year research and dissemination project between Emory University, University of Washington, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with other academic and health department partners. The UW contribution will address HIV prevention questions that relate to understanding the interlocking relationships between HIV prevention methods, primarily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and STD transmission and treatment, to understand the future course of the HIV epidemic and STD transmission. Because of the complex feedback and high-dimensionality of the behaviors and subgroups of interest, agent-based modeling is well-suited. These model-based answers will be critical for motivating policy-makers around funding prioritization for PrEP and the settings in which it would be emphasized. All concurred that due to the complexity of agent-based model development and the nuanced questions, this is a long-term activity that will take on different phases across the 5 years of the project.


### Research Question
**How might HIV incidence and prevalence change among adolelecent sexual minority males if PrEP were made available to this younger at risk population?** If higher and meaningful levels of PrEP coverage is seen for adolecent sexual minority males significant early infections could be averted.  An analysis of coverage and adherence will be conducted to determine the minimum targets for reducing infections.
